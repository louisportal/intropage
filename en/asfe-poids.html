<!-- SHARED: The weight of ASFE -->

<div class="about-content">
    <p>The Alliance Solidaire des Français de l'Étranger (ASFE) today holds a leading position in this system of representation. A unique cross-party movement — entirely dedicated to defending the interests of French citizens abroad beyond left-right divides — ASFE has established itself as one of the most structured and influential players in the ecosystem.</p>

    <p>In the Senate, ASFE holds <strong>3 out of 12 seats</strong> among senators for French citizens abroad, representing a quarter of the senatorial representation of this community — a considerable weight that gives it a strong voice in legislative work and government oversight.</p>

    <p>At the AFE, ASFE leads the <strong>"Solidaires & Indépendants"</strong> group, which carries a pragmatic and results-oriented vision, putting efficiency at the service of expatriates rather than partisan quarrels.</p>

    <p>ASFE is also one of the most active networks in terms of informing and supporting French citizens abroad, with a rich editorial platform covering all everyday topics (taxation, education, social protection, security, employment...).</p>

    <p>With the consular elections of May 2026 approaching, ASFE positions itself as a natural choice for expatriates who want competent, committed representatives truly serving the French community abroad.</p>
