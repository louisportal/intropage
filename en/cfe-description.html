        <div class="about-content">
            <p>Councillors for French Citizens Abroad are <strong>locally elected representatives</strong>, created by the law of July 22, 2013. Elected by direct universal suffrage on gender-equal lists, for a 6-year term, by French citizens registered on consular electoral rolls, there are currently 442 spread across 130 constituencies worldwide (433 for the next election in May 2026).</p>

            <p><strong>Who are they?</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                <li>French citizens living abroad, elected by their expatriate compatriots</li>
                <li>Each consular constituency has 1 to 9 councillors, depending on the number of registered French citizens</li>
                <li>They serve largely on a voluntary basis, with a modest flat-rate allowance to cover travel expenses</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>What do they do on a daily basis?</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                <li>They represent and assist French citizens in their constituency with their dealings with the embassy or consulate</li>
                <li>They sit on the consular council, the local body that meets at least twice a year to address concrete issues: school grants, social assistance, employment and vocational training, security, support for associations (STAFE)</li>
                <li>They issue advisory opinions and make recommendations on all matters affecting the lives of French citizens in their constituency</li>
                <li>They relay the needs and concerns from the field to the administration, government, and parliamentarians</li>
                <li>They contribute to local civic and associative life and support concrete initiatives</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>What role in national representation?</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                <li>They are grand electors and participate in the election of the 12 senators for French citizens abroad</li>
                <li>Among the 442 councillors, 90 are elected by their peers to sit on the Assembly of French Citizens Abroad (AFE), the national consultative assembly that dialogues directly with the government on all public policies concerning expatriates</li>
                <li>They work alongside the 11 members of parliament for French citizens abroad</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>In summary</strong>, they are the equivalent of municipal councillors, but for French communities abroad — your direct contacts at the consular level.</p>

        <div class="about-content">
            <p>The Alliance Solidaire des Français de l'Étranger (ASFE) today holds a leading position in this system of representation. A unique cross-party movement — entirely dedicated to defending the interests of French citizens abroad beyond left-right divides — ASFE has established itself as one of the most structured and influential players in the ecosystem.</p>

            <p>In the Senate, ASFE holds <strong>3 out of 12 seats</strong> among senators for French citizens abroad, representing a quarter of the senatorial representation of this community — a considerable weight that gives it a strong voice in legislative work and government oversight.</p>

            <p>At the AFE, ASFE leads the <strong>"Solidaires & Indépendants"</strong> group, which carries a pragmatic and results-oriented vision, putting efficiency at the service of expatriates rather than partisan quarrels.</p>

            <p>ASFE is also one of the most active networks in terms of informing and supporting French citizens abroad, with a rich editorial platform covering all everyday topics (taxation, education, social protection, security, employment...).</p>

            <p>With the consular elections of May 2026 approaching, ASFE positions itself as a natural choice for expatriates who want competent, committed representatives truly serving the French community abroad.</p>
